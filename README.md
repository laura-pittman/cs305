The newest client, Artemis Financial, is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their customers. The client wants to modernize their operations, and as a crucial part of the success of their custom software, they also want to use the most current and effective software security. Something I did very well after finding security vulnerabilities in the client's software was immediately take action to thoroughly investigate each vulnerability to find an appropriate and effective solution. It is imperative to code securely to ensure the software and any information being utilized by it is protected and safe from anyone who may want to use said information in malicious ways. Software security adds value to a company's overall wellbeing as it allows employees and customers alike to know they can trust the company, their information is safe, and they are in good hands.
